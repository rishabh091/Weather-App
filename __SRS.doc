Requirements : 
1. The app consists of a grid of 9 panels. Every panel shows the weather data of one
city. Initially, all panels would be empty.

2. On clicking on an empty panel, a text box is shown on the panel itself, asking the
user to enter the city name. On entering the name, the panel now shows weather
data for that city.
(COMPLETED)

3. Every panel should have an “Edit” button - on clicking this, the user should be
able to change the city shown in that panel.

4. If there was an error in getting the data (eg. wrong city name), the panel itself
shows the error and the user can re-enter the city name.
(COMPLETED)

5. Every panel has a background picture that describes the weather at the city - eg.
sunny/rainy/cloudy.

themselves in a row with respect to the screen size: for small screens - less
number of panels in a row and for large screens - more number of panels in a
row.
